# MapsDirection

This is a simple app which uses Google Maps API and Directions API to find directions between 2 points in a map. 
Firstly using maps Api, 3 pointers are set at Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai. Whenever the user tries to access the Directions API, a request is made using a url. After that a json object is returned which gives the direction between 2 places. Using a polyline, the direction is shown on the map.
